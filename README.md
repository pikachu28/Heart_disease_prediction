### Input required for prediction


**Age**

**Sex**

**Chest pain**

      0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart
      
      1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart
      
      2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)
      
      3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease
      
      
**trestbps** - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern

**chol** - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

      serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides
      
      above 200 is cause for concern
      
**fbs** -  (1 = true; 0 = false)

**restecg** - resting electrocardiographic results

      0: Nothing to note
      
      1: ST-T Wave abnormality can range from mild symptoms to severe problems
      
      signals non-normal heart beat
      
      2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber
      
**thalach** - maximum heart rate achieved

**exang** - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

**oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest looks at stress of heart during excercise unhealthy heart will stress more
